## Background

I am a front end developer with a specialty in User Experience Design and WordPress, a UX/UI instructor with UCF Bootcamps, and a student studying for my Masters in FinTech. I discovered a passion for the psychology beneath computing, and studying how designing for people can drive improvements in technology and our everyday lives.

I have been with the UCF family for nearly a decade, first as a student, then as an undergraduate research in Human Computer Interaction, and now as a web developer and an instructor. With UCF I've discovered the biggest passions in my life, computer science, and teaching.

I am currently the lead website developer for the division of Administration and Finance, and manage and develop for over 30 websites. I work alongside a team of experienced software and database developers, and bring the unique perspective of user-centered design to my teams.

In my free time I love to build custom mechanical keyboards, play Dungeons and Dragons, and build computers.
